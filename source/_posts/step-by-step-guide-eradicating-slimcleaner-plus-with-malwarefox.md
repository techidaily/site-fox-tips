## What is SlimCleaner Plus?

The SlimCleaner Plus or commonly known as adware is a potentially unwanted program that showcases itself as software for system optimization. Moreover, it tricks you into buying a subscription and slows down your system. Once you have installed this program into your computer, it continues to put forth pop-up notifications to remind you to get a subscription by showcasing underlying issues with your PC. The majority of problems are fake and just to trick you. 

The SlimCleaner Plus is not considered malware, as it is installed on your computer with your consent. It runs unnecessary advertisements, monitors your activity, and even makes changes to your browser settings. So, if you have installed it on your computer, let’s learn how you can remove it.
