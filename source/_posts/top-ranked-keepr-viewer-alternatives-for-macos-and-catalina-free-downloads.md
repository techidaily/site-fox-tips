### Main problems when using KeepVid:

**1\. No KeepVid for Mac Version**

Until now, KeepVid has no Mac version, which brings much inconvenience for Mac users. When you want to use KeepVid to download video clips on your Mac OS X computers, you must be disappointed. So, it is common for Mac users complaining that KeepVid is not working on Mac.

**2\. Java errors**

When you first apply KeepVid.com, it's quite often that KeepVid reminds you to install Java, as KeepVid employs Java as a tool to fetch the links of the downloading videos. However, there occurs some issues like even when you have installed Java already, KeepVid still asks you to install Java, maybe because you didn't download the lastest Java version. In some cases, the browser even doesn't allow you to install any plug-in, for example, the latest Google Chrome has blocked Java applet by default.

**3\. Does not support all websites**

Although KeepVid allows users to download videos from most of the video-sharing sites including YouTube, 5min, blip.tv, Break, CollegeHumor , Dailymotion, eHow, FunnyJunk, Photobucket, but you may still find some fantastic video clips from other websites excluded by KeepVid.

**4\. Annoying advertisements**

As one of many free video downloaders, KeepVid has the same issue, full of annoying ads. The download tabs for ads are much more obvious than the videos', which misleads users frequently.

**5\. No video conversion function**

If you want to convert some of the videos downloaded from KeepVid to formats compatible with your portable devices, you will find it's a pity KeepVid don't support video converting.
