## How can Malware Hide from Task Manager?

There are various ways a malicious program can remain hidden from Task Manager. Here are some of those.

### Re-Creating Itself

One common method is to create a process that constantly re-creates itself or starts up again after it’s terminated. This makes it difficult for users to catch and end the process because as soon as they terminate one instance, another pops up in its place.

### Running Under a Legitimate Process

One way that malware can do this is by using a process called “process hollowing.” This is when a malware program creates a copy of a legitimate process in memory, then replaces the legitimate process with itself. This allows the malware to run undetected because it appears as if the legitimate process is still running. This makes it appear as if the legitimate process is the one using up resources when in reality, it’s the malware.

### Hiding Its Path

Some malware also tries to hide its path so that users can’t see where it’s located on their system. This makes it more difficult to find and remove the malicious program.

### Using a Rootkit

Another way that malware can hide is by using rootkits to modify the way that the operating system works. A rootkit is a type of malware that’s designed to hide itself and other malicious programs on a system. Rootkits can be used to hide processes, files, and even registry keys from the user. They can also be used to disable security features, such as antivirus software.

### Obfuscation

Obfuscation is a technique used to make code difficult to understand. It’s often used to make malware more difficult to detect and analyze. Hackers will use obfuscation to make it more difficult for task manager to detect their malware.

## How to Stay Safe From Malware?

Given the fact that malware can evade detection from antivirus software, it’s important to take steps to protect your computer from these threats. Below are some tips that you can use to stay safe from malware:

### Update Your Antivirus Software

One of the most important things you can do is to keep your antivirus software up-to-date. Cybercriminals are constantly developing new ways to avoid detection. By keeping your antivirus software up-to-date, you will make sure that it can detect and remove the latest threats.

### Use a Firewall

A firewall can help to protect your computer from malware. A firewall will block incoming connections from untrusted sources. This will make it more difficult for malware to infect your computer.

### Use Caution When Opening Email Attachments

One of the most common ways that malware is spread is through email attachments. Be careful when opening email attachments, even if they appear to be from a trusted source. If you’re not sure about an attachment, don’t open it.
