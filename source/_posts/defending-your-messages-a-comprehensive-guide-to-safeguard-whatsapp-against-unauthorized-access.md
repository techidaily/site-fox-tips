However, after Facebook took it over, many users were worried about the privacy and security of their chats on WhatsApp. This concern is totally justified as [Facebook has a history of security and privacy issues](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/facebook-data-privacy-scandal-a-cheat-sheet/). After the incorporation with Facebook, WhatsApp was quick to introduce some advanced features to make messaging secure and private. The features such as End-to-End Encryption, biometric lock, security notification, and _two-step verification_ all are primarily privacy-focused.

If you are concerned about your privacy while using the WhatsApp application, here are the top features you should enable to secure WhatsApp on your device.

## Enable Two-Step Verification

One of the essential security features that most people ignore on WhatsApp is **Two-step verification**. Two-step verification or two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your WhatsApp account. Enabling it would stop someone else from accessing your account without your permission. 

To enable the Two-step verification, follow these steps:

1. Open the WhatsApp application and navigate to **Settings -> Account,** and click on **Two-step verification**.  
![tap two step verification](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-two-step-verification.png)
2. Click on **Enable** and follow the on-screen instructions to set up the authentication.  
![enable two step verification](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/enable-two-step-verification.png)
3. You will be asked to add a 6-digit pin and then an email address.
4. The setup will be completed after entering the required details.![two step verification enabled](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/two-step-verification-enabled.png)

The Two-step verification will ensure that anytime you try to activate WhatsApp on any other device, you will be asked to enter the 6-digit passcode. The [email address](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) is optional, but you should enter it to recover the 6-digit PIN in case you forget it.

After enabling this, WhatsApp will randomly ask you for the 6-digit passcode so that you remember it.

## Verify End-to-End Encryption

After introducing end-to-end encryption, WhatsApp has enabled it by default across all chats, and users cannot disable it. However, when sharing sensitive information, such as Credit Card PIN, with someone through WhatsApp chat, it is better to double-check the encryption status. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open WhatsApp and start the conversation with the contact with whom you want to share the sensitive details.
2. Inside the chatbox, tap on the contact’s name/number, and select **Encryption**.![tap encryption](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-encryption.png)
3. You will see the 60-digit security number code and a QR code.![security code whatsapp](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/security-code-whatsapp.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

4. To verify the end-to-end encryption, either scan the code with the contact’s phone or compare the 60-digit code on their device. If the code matches, the chat is end-to-end encrypted.

## Enable Security Notifications

Whenever you use WhatsApp on a different device, the security code of end-to-end encryption gets changed. To know about this change, you can enable the Security notifications on WhatsApp. Turning this option ON would notify you about the security number changes of the contacts you chat with. This way, you can verify the encryption before sharing something delicate. Here is how you can enable the Security notifications.

1. Launch the WhatsApp application and head towards **Settings -> Account**.
2. On the Account settings, tap on **Security**.![tap security](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-security.png)
3. Toggle the button to turn ON the Security notifications.![enable security notification](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/enable-security-notification.png)
4. You will get these notifications when the security code changes.![security notifications](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/security-notifications.png)

## Enable Disappearing Messages

Disappearing Messages is one of the latest added privacy features in WhatsApp. It can be enabled on both private and group chats. On group chats, it can only be enabled by the Admins. After enabling this feature, the texts, images, voice notes, or videos shared would be automatically deleted after seven days of sharing.

To enable it, follow these steps:

1. Launch WhatsApp and open the contact’s chat or group with whom you want to share disappearing messages.
2. Tap on the name/number inside the chatbox.
3. Select the **Disappearing messages** option.![tap disappearing messages](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-disappearing-messages.png)
4. Tap **Continue** to get started with the disappearing messages.![get started with disappearing message](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/get-started-with-disappearing-message.png)
5. Select the **On** bullet option to enable the setting.![disappearing message enabled](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/disappearing-message-enabled.png)

The drawback of this feature is that the messages can be saved in other ways like Screenshots, or transferring the photos, videos, and voice notes somewhere else within the seven days. Moreover, WhatsApp will notify the contact about the disappearing messages, and both the participants can control this setting, irrespective of who turned it ON or OFF. This nullifies the practicality of the feature. However, the advantage is that enabling the feature would clear the clutter from the group chats.

## Enable View Once for Photos/Videos

Another privacy-focused feature that was recently added is **View Once**. While sharing a photo or video in a personal or group chat, you get the option to enable the View Once. It will ensure that after an image or video is viewed by the recipients once, they won’t be able to reaccess it.

Here is how you can use the **View Once** feature:

1. Open WhatsApp and select the group or contact with whom you want to share the View Once media.
2. Tap on the attachment icon and select the photo/video to share from the Gallery. You can also instantly click the picture or shoot the video to share.
3. After selecting the media, tap on the ‘1’ icon to set it for View only once.![enable view once](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/enable-view-once.png)
4. You will get the notification that the photo is set to View Once.![view once enabled](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/view-once-set.png)
5. After the receiver views the media once, you will be notified about that too (only if Read receipts is enabled).

Again, this feature also has the practicality issue as the receiver can easily take a screenshot of the images shared without letting the sender know about it.

## Perform Tweaks in Privacy Settings

WhatsApp provides you options to configure some privacy settings as per your preference. After opening the app, navigate to **Settings -> Account -> Privacy**. You can perform changes in the following options:

![privacy options](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/privacy-options.png)

* **Last Seen:** set it to _Everyone_, _My contacts_, or _Nobody_ as per your preference.
* **Profile Photo:** set it to _Everyone_, _My contacts_, or _Nobody_ as per your preference. This will let you put your picture and hide it from unknowns.
* **About:** set it to _Everyone_, _My contacts_, or _Nobody_ as per your preference.
* **Status:** set it to _My contacts_**,** _My contacts except_**,** or _Only share with_.  
   * **My contacts:** show your statuses to all your contacts**.**  
   * **My contacts except:** let you choose the contacts with whom you don’t want to share your statuses.  
   * **Only share with:** let you choose the specific contacts only with those your status would be shared.
* **Read Receipts:** after enabling it, the sender would not know whether you have seen the messages or not. It does not apply to group messages.
* **Groups:** let you choose who can add you to groups: _Everyone_, _My contacts_, or _My contacts except_.
* **Live location:** let you configure the live location setting if you are sharing it with any contact.
* **Blocked contacts:** let you add or remove the contacts from the block list.
* **Fingerprint Lock:** This is one of the critical features as **_WhatsApp now does not permit third-party app locks_**. Enable Fingerprint lock to add an extra security layer to access your WhatsApp account. Allowing it would prevent others from opening your chats. You can set it to _lock immediately_, _after 1 minute_, or _after 30 minutes_, as per your preference.![fingerprint lock](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fingerprint-lock.png)

## Disable the Cloud Backup

As discussed in an earlier section, WhatsApp by default provides end-to-end encryption to all your chats. However, if you restore the chats that are backed up on Google Drive or other cloud services, those chats would be excluded from the encryption. So, if you really are privacy concerned, you can disable the Cloud backup.

Here is how:

1. Open Whatsapp and navigate to **Settings -> Chats**.![chat settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/chats-settings.png)
2. Scroll down and tap on **Chat backup**.![tap on chat backup](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tap-on-chat-backup.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

3. Now, tap on **Back up to Google Drive**.![back up to Google drive](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/back-up-to-Google-drive.png)
4. From the options, select **Never** bullet point.![never back up](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/never-back-up.png)
