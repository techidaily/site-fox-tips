## How To Know Your Device Is Infected by a Ransomware?

There are a few telltale signs that your device has been infected by ransomware. If you see any of the following, it is time to take action:

* A message pops up on your screen demanding a ransom be paid in order to regain access to your computer or data.
* Your computer is locked and you are unable to access any of your files. Every file is encrypted and appended with a strange extension.
* You see strange activity on your computer, such as new programs that you didn’t install or changes to your homepage.
* Other than that, your computer seems to be running slow or behaving strangely.

If you notice any of these signs, it is important to take action immediately. The longer you wait, the more damage the ransomware can do.

Once you have found a removal tool, follow the instructions carefully. These tools can be difficult to use, so it is important to read the instructions carefully before using them.

### Get Full Information About the Ransomware

Some ransomware will provide you with a way to contact the person who is holding your data ransom. This is usually done through an email address or a website.

If you are able to get this information, it is important to get as much as you can. This includes the amount of money they are demanding, what methods of payment they accept and any other instructions they provide.

## What Should You Do in Case of Ransomware Attack?

If you suspect that your device is infected, the first thing you should do is disconnect from the internet. This will prevent the ransomware from spreading to other devices on your network and prevent it from encrypting any more of your data.

Once you are offline, you can start the process of removing the ransomware and recovering your data. There are a few different methods you can try, but we will outline the most effective ones here.

### Use an Anti-Malware Program

The first step is to run a full scan of your computer with an anti-malware program. This will remove any malicious files and programs from your device. The ant-malware or anti-ransomware programs are specially designed to target these types of threats, so they are the most effective at removing them.

There are a few different anti-malware programs you can use, but we recommend using TotalAV. It is pretty effective at removing ransomware and other types of malware.

### Restore From a Backup

If you have a recent backup of your data, you can restore your computer to its previous state. This will remove any ransomware that is on your device and replace it with backed-up data.

To do this, you will need to boot into Safe Mode. On Windows, you can do this by pressing the F11 key while your computer is booting up. Once in Safe Mode, you can access your backup files and restore them to your computer. However, one danger of restoring from a backup is you might re-infect your PC if your backup contains malicious files.

### Recover Data Using a Data Recovery Application

If you don’t have a backup of your data, you can try using a data recovery application. These programs can often recover files that have been encrypted by ransomware. Data Recovery tools are not 100% effective, but they may be able to recover some of your data.

### Use a Ransomware Decryption Tool

There are a number of different ransomware decryption tools out there that can decrypt your files without having to pay the ransom. This is a good option if you don’t have a backup or if the ransomware has encrypted your backup files as well.

You can get ransomware decryption tools from top security solution providers like Kaspersky, Symantec, and Bitdefender.

Following is the list of popular decryptors:

* [Quick Heal Ransomware Tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/quickheal/products/)
* [Emisoft Tools](https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/free-download)
* [Kaspersky Free Ransomware Decryptors](https://noransom.kaspersky.com/)
* [Avast Ransomware Decryption Tools](https://www.avast.com/en-in/ransomware-decryption-tools)
* [McAfee Ransomware Decryptors](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-in/downloads/free-tools/ransomware-decryption.html)
* [AVG Ransomware Decryption Tools](https://www.avg.com/en-in/ransomware-decryption-tools)
* [No More Ransom Decryptors](https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html)

### Contact a Professional

If you are still having trouble removing the ransomware or decrypting your files, you can always contact a professional for help. There are a number of companies that specialize in computer security and data recovery.

Just be sure to do your research before you hire someone, as there are a lot of scams out there.

## Should You Pay Ransom To Decrypt Your Data?

As a general rule, you should never pay the ransom. There is no guarantee that you will get your data back even if you do pay, and you are just giving the criminals money that they can use to fund future attacks.

In some cases, however, paying the ransom may be the only way to get your data back. If you have tried all of the other methods and you are still unable to decrypt your files, you may have no choice but to pay the ransom.

Before you do this, however, we recommend talking to a professional about your options. They may be able to help you get your data back without having to pay the ransom.

Paying the ransom also supports criminal activity and helps to fund future attacks. So, even if you are able to get your data back, you are still supporting criminals.

## Best Practices To Protect Yourself From Ransomware Attack

The best way to protect yourself from ransomware is to have a good backup strategy in place. This way, if you do get infected with ransomware, you can restore your data from a backup and avoid having to pay the ransom. Here are some other things you should practice.

**How can I tell if my computer has ransomware?** 

There are a few different ways you can tell if your computer has been infected with ransomware. One way is to look for a ransom note. This is usually a text file that is placed on your desktop or in your documents folder. The ransom note will usually tell you how to contact the attackers and how to pay the ransom.

**How did I get ransomware?** 

There are a few different ways that you can get infected with ransomware. One way is by clicking on a malicious link in an email or on a website. Another way is by downloading a malicious attachment from an email. Finally, you can also get infected by installing a malicious program on the internet.
