## 1. How to Convert Your Favorite Reddit Content Into MP4 or AVI Files - Two Easy Techniques

### Overview

Reddit is an American social website which allows users to upload links, text posts, images and videos to Reddit for sharing to others. When users browse Reddit, there must be some videos that users want to download for offline playback, but how to download them? I believe that many users have found that Reddit has not designed a Download button for users to download Reddit videos. To serve users who have the Reddit video downloading need, the following just introduces two widely used methods to help users to download videos from Reddit.

### Method One: Use Redv

Redv is a good Reddit video downloader which can help to download any video from Reddit for free. Redv helps users to download Reddit videos for offline playback on their computers. Users can use the following two ways to download Reddit videos:

* Open the Reddit video to its playing interface, copy its video URL and paste it to Redv URL box and then click the Download button to get the imported Reddit video downloaded.
* When you get the Reddit video URL in its address bar, replace reddit.com with redditdl.com instead of copying the entire video URL, and then hit Enter key on your computer to get the needed Reddit video downloaded.

Well, Redv only helps users to download Reddit videos with fixed output format and sometimes the output quality does not satisfy users who demand high output quality. When these unsatisfying situations happen, users had better try the following Method Two to help user to download Reddit videos.

### Method Two: Use Allavsoft
