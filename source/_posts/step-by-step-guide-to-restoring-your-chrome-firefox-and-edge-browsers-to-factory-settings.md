## Why do you need to Reset the Browser?

Apart from being able to provide various features on its own; there are also some additional programs available that improve the browsing experience further. These programs are called extensions or add-ons; which renders extra powers and features to the browsers’ interface to every page it loads. However, difficulties do happen with these browsers, no matter how well they are programmed.

The issues comprise frequent crash; unnecessary ad pop-ups; unwanted re-directions; security threats; etc. It eventually, they slow down the system’s performance, and hence it needs to be cleared forthwith. The default and accessible way to solve these kinds of problems is to reset the browser to default settings.

Are you hindered with such issues in your browser? Are you looking for the ways to reset your browser? Then, you’re at the right place. It is quite an easy endeavor; however, the default state will almost erase everything. For example, the settings that you’ve made on Toolbars; Privacy & Security settings; browser preferences; add-ons; extensions; themes; etc. will be removed.

Resetting doesn’t delete your bookmarks; saved passwords; and sometimes even the browsing history. Hence there is nothing to be worried.
