* Again a dialogue box will appear, where you’ll have to click the **“Refresh Firefox”** button**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6-3.png)

Now, you have successfully reset the Firefox to its default state. The refresh feature will create a new profile for the users. Firefox will store all of the critical data on the desktop in a new folder, named as “**Old Firefox Data**.”

The steps above will help you to change your browser to its default stage. But still, it won’t delete your data completely; your password and add-ons will stay in your browser, within which specific threats may hide. Hence, the steps above can’t be an ultimate solution, at times.

## Keep your Browsing Experience Safe

In any case, it is essential to protect your PC from all kinds of malware attack. The only potentially practical solution for this is, installing a good anti-malware software. You might already have an antivirus enabled on your computer.

Antivirus programs aren’t capable of identifying many kinds of new and emerging malware. Therefore, an anti-malware is the only solution for getting over the malware and spyware correctly. On that note, it is highly recommended to use MalwareFox, an efficient anti-malware that significantly helps in removing the various types of malware from your system. It delivers better results when compared to the process of resetting the browser to default settings.
