## Convert and Save CNBC Footage as High-Quality MP4, WMV, or AVI Files for Easy Viewing!

### Overview

Want to download CNBC U.S. video, Asia video, Europe video, CEO interviews, etc to your mobile phones or other local devices for offline watching at leisure time?

**This article just introduces a CNBC downloader - Allavsoft with which you can download CNBC video without effort.**

CNBC provides video reprint license service. If you have paid for a video reprint license, you can post CNBC video to your blog, corporate website, intranet site or other networks, like YouTube, Facebook, etc by embedding the CNBC video link and if the visitor clicks the video link the visitor will still stay on your web page and is not redirected to CNBC. The only drawback with this service for users is that the file format of this service is limited to Windows Media files and the video is not allowed to edit. If you want another video format, like DVD, you need to pay for another reprint license. From the above we can see even if you have paid for the video reprint license, you still have limitation for using CNBC videos, not to mention to download CNBC videos for more offline purposes which is almost impossible.
